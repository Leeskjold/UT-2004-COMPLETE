1. Download from given link and extract anywhere. I'd use "C:\UT2004"

2. Launch UT2004.reg and accept. This will install a key for the game, useful for new installs and systems.

3. Once the game is launched and at the main menu, press ` on your keyboard to enter the console.

4. Once there, paste  "set IpDrv.MasterServerLink MasterServerList ((Address="utmaster.openspy.net",Port=28902))"  without quotes and relaunch the game.

You should be good to go! I will provede mods and maps as well if requested. Happy gaming!
